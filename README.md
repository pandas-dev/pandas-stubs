# pandas-stubs

## Public type stubs for pandas

This is the home for pandas typing stubs supported by the pandas core team.  The stubs are likely incomplete in terms of covering the published API of pandas.

### Development Paradigm

To contribute changes to the stubs, you must include an appropriate test.  See `pandas-stubs/tests` for examples.

## Build instructions

Use `python setup.py build bdist_wheel` to build the wheel.  NOTE:  `setuptools 62.3.2` is required!

## Evolution

These stubs were forked from the project <https://github.com/microsoft/python-type-stubs> as of commit `6b800063bde687cd1846122431e2a729a9de625a`

As both projects move forward, this page will track what the differences are (if any).  There is an expectation that, in the near future, the Microsoft project will start pulling these stubs for inclusion in Visual Studio Code releases.

## Thanks

We are indebted to Microsoft and that project for the initial set of public type stubs.  We are also grateful for the original pandas-stubs project at <https://github.com/VirtusLab/pandas-stubs> that created the framework for testing the stubs.
