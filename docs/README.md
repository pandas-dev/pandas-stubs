# Development paradigm with pandas-stubs

For any update to the stubs, we require an associated test case that should fail without
a proposed change, and works with a proposed change.  See <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas-stubs/tree/main/tests/> for examples.

Instructions for working with the code are found here:

- [How to set up the environment](setup.md)
- [How to test the project](tests.md)
- [Code style](style.md)
